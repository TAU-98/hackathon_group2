**Eye-scan monitoring of decision strategies in multi-attribute choice.**
This project aims to convert a MATLAB-based decision-making experiment into a fully functional
Python version integrated with an eye-tracking system. Beyond code translation, it enables real-time
collection and analysis of eye-movement data to investigate cognitive strategies in multi-attribute
decision-making under time pressure. The implementation supports dynamic visualization, trial
customization, and compatibility with open-source tools, increasing flexibility, reproducibility, and
usability for future behavioral and neurocognitive research. This tool lays the groundwork for
developing computational models based on gaze data, with potential applications in AI, human-
computer interaction, and cognitive diagnostics.
